    "\n",
    "<i>Hello there</i><br><br>\n",
    "About six months ago, I was tasked with an assignment to create an interactive dashboard. I did a research and came across <a href='https://plotly.com/dash/'><b>Dash</b></a>  from <a href='https://plotly.com/python/'><b>Plotly</b></a>. It is quite an appealing interactive dashboard and, as I learn from my research, it is probably one of the most popular framework for building ML and data science web apps.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"><i><b>Now, what does it mean for you as a data scientist?</b></i></div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "> If you are a data scientist who uses python on a regular basis, you are probably already familiar with Python scripting, visualization with pandas, seaborn, matplotlib or even plotly already. But what about web development framework? CSS/HTML or even JavaScript? <br> \n",
    ">- HTML controls the page rendering in a web browser \n",
    ">- CSS controls the <font color='maroon'><b>color</b></font>, <b><font face='san-serif'>font</font></b>, and other styling \n",
    ">- JavaScript controls all those \"actions\" on your webpage, e.g. on-clicked then do-something, or, mouse-over then do-something.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>That's where Dash comes in.</b> Dash is a Python library built on top of <b><a href='https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/'>flask</a></b>, which is also a web development framework. With flask, you can build a webapp with pure Python. Dash together with flask framework, means that you can stay in Python land, build interactive charts/graphs, focus your attention on machine learning models, visualize the results and explain business implication; without having to code CSS/HTML/JS. Once done, you can hand your code over to IT for deployment. (<i>But of course</i>, all the better if you already know CSS/HTML/JS, because you can apply your skill via dash api, like so <code>html.H1</code> or <code>html.Div</code>). The best resource to learn HTML syntax is <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp'><b>W3School</b></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"><b><i>Okay, you don't need to worry about HTML but you might still need to worry about style/action? CSS/JS?</i></b></div>\n",
    "    \n",
    ">Because! you probably don't want your dashboard to look like a ripped off from a tutorial, no? <br>\n",
    "and you probably need menu, sidebar, popup, or tooltip, yes?\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "<b>That's where Dash-Bootstrap-Component comes in.</b>  But first, let's make a distinction between <b>Bootstrap</b> framework and <b>Dash-Bootstrap-Component</b>. <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/'><b>Bootstrap</b></a> is a CSS/JS framework of which you can easily include in your web application. It also empowers your application with a collapsible menu, sidebar menu, carousel ,and lots more. Below is one example of an application with Bootstrap framework. \n",

    "<img src=\"images/bootstrapapp.png\"  width=\"500\" height=\"600\">\n",

Also, if you are like me whose designing skill is not that <i>sexy</i>, there are many free <a href='https://bootswatch.com/'><b>themes</b></a> to choose from. \n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"><b><i>I spent hours and days before I could build a practical dashboard!</i></b></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The official tutorials are informative alright, but they are quite disconnected. I spent hours and days, jumping from one tutorial to another, to figure out how everything works together. Six months ago, I wish I had a tutorial that is, short and concise, all in one place, and just enough to get me started and build on top of it. There wasn't any, so I decided to create one. \n",
